# Volumetric Data Interaction in AR Using a Handheld Touch-Sensitive Tablet
This prototypical implementation allows the interaction with volumetric data using a handheld tablet in a mixed reality environment. It can be placed along Milgram's reality virtuality contiunuum. While it was developed for AR, it can also be used in VR.

Keywords: `Augmented Reality`, `Volumetric Data`, `Surface Data`, `Touch Input`, `Spatial Input`, `Tangible User Interface`, `Cutting plane`

## Master thesis
The basis of this application was developed in the course of a master thesis which is available at the HIVE website: <br />
https://hive.fh-hagenberg.at/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Master-Thesis_v.1.23.pdf

The basic concept, design, and implementation are described in the thesis. A quantitative study was conducted which evaluated the different functionalities and summed up an outlook over different feature changes.

### Features
The following features are already described in the master thesis and functional since July 2022.

#### Spatial features
* Repositioning
* Reorientating
* Resizing

#### Exploration features
* Temporary removing parts using a cutting plane
* Permanent removing parts
* Creating snapshots
* Explore snapshot neighbours

In these videos a `HTC Vive Pro Eye` was used in combination with a `Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite`

## Structure
The prototype utilises two applications, the client which is deployed on the tablet, and the host which runs on the PC. Both need to be in the
Two applications - here in main an din client branch

## Used Technology
